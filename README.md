# About Color Maps

It's a thing.

## USAGE

Here's a simple example: a content column with a sidebar on each side, aligned to a 12 column grid.

```scss
  @import "color-maps";
```

## INSTALLATION

Color Maps is distributed as a Ruby Gem. On your computer, simply run:

```sh
gem install color-maps
```

If you are using Compass (and you should!) then you can add it to an existing project by editing the project's configuration file, config.rb, and adding this line:

```ruby
require 'color-maps'
```

You can then start using Color Maps in your Sass files. Just add this line to one of your .sass or .scss files and start creating!

```scss
@import "color-maps";
```
